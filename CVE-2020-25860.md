### Description and Impact
A time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability exists in the code that checks and installs a firmware bundle.

When running "rauc install bundle.raucb" or using the 'Install/InstallBundle'
D-Bus methods, RAUC does the following:
1. check_bundle() – verify the bundle signature via OpenSSL by opening it using
   the file name
2. mount_bundle() – mount the bundle via a loopback device, re-opening it by
   file name
3. install the content of the bundle, possibly executing hook scripts

If the attacker is able to replace the bundle file between steps 1. and 2.,
RAUC will mount and install the modified bundle. Also, if the attacker is able
to modify the bundle file after step 2., they can modify the payload to be
installed or cause arbitrary hooks to be executed during the installation.

### Requirements for the Attack

This vulnerability requires the attacker to be able to replace or modify the
bundle file on disk, while RAUC is installing it (required privileges depend on
where the file is originally stored).
If an attacker has no write access to the location where bundles are installed
from and cannot trigger an installation, the vulnerability cannot be exploited.

Thus, if the rauc service is disabled (via the --disable-service option to
configure) and bundles are only installed by root from a safe location, the
vulnerability is not exploitable by other users.

If the system contains an update service accessible from the network and this
service stores the bundle to always the same location and does not deny uploads
while an installation is running, both vulnerabilities can be combined to a
remote attack. Note that the CGI example included with RAUC denies uploads
while an installation is running.

### Recommendation

If the attack is applicable to your system, you should update to RAUC version
1.5.

As part of preparing the update, verify that the new version is still able to
install further updates. More information on the migration process is available
in the Integration chapter under Bundle Format Migration (docs/integration.rst
in the source).

### Technical Background

While the vulnerability to replacing the bundle file could be fixed through
avoiding any re-opening of bundle, this is not enough to protect against
concurrent modification of the mounted bundle file.

RAUC's original bundle format consists of a payload (a squashfs filesystem)
protected by a CMS signature. This means that the payload must be authenticated
as a whole before accessing it and any subsequent modification cannot be
detected.

As most systems using RAUC have little spare storage space, making a temporary
private copy of the to-be-installed bundle is not feasible. This means that
with the original bundle format the only possible mitigation is to ensure that
no concurrent modification by an attacker is possible.

### Solution

The solution implemented in RAUC version 1.5 consists of three parts:
A: opening the bundle file only once
B: protecting the bundle file against modification during installation
C: introducing a new bundle format

Part A solves the issue of re-opening the bundle after signature verification.
RAUC will now create the loop-back device directly from the open file
descriptor without using the losetup tool.

Part B protects against concurrent modification of the open bundle after
signature verification. This is done by taking ownership of the bundle file,
restricting write permissions and then checking for pre-existing open file
descriptors using the lease mechanism provided by the Linux kernel (fcntl with
F_SETLEASE). Additionally, filesytems which could be provided by the attacker
(such as FUSE oder NFS) are rejected.

With A and B, installations of bundles using the original ("plain") bundle
format are protected against the vulnerability.

As a longer-term solution, part C adds a new bundle format based on the
dm-verity [1] device mapper target. With this format, the payload is not
authenticated as a separate step, but directly by the kernel during every
payload access. This way, even bundles located on untrusted storage can be
safely installed. In the future, this will allow incrementally downloading a
bundle over the network, even with an untrusted connection or server.

RAUC automatically detects the bundle format and can be configured to reject
formats.

Until a fixed version is available in your build system, you may want to
integrate it yourself. For OpenEmbedded/Yocto, PTXdist and Buildroot, we have
prepared examples to help with the update to 1.5:
https://github.com/rauc/rauc-1.5-integration

If your system uses an unsupported version of OpenSSL (<1.1.1), a backport
patch is available in the rauc-1.5-integration repository above. Note that this
patch does not have the same breadth of testing as the 1.5 release.
